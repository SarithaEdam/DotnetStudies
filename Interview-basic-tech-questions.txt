Question: Explain about the projects you worked on.------------------------------------------

Answer:
I used to work on projects like mutual fund web applications, that have many modules. [User profile, new Purchase, additional purchase, SIP, STP, and their prepaid modules].
I developed some of the modules such as payment-process, user-profile, prepaid-STP, combo-SIP, and multi-goal-SIP.
