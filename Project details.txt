Project 1: Edelweiss Mutual Fund 
Mutual fund: It is an investment platform where we can invest the money to get profits.
Des: In this mutual fund, two types of people are there like Investors and distributors, where investors can explore the mutual fund by taking different schemes.
Where distributors can invest in the scheme of mutual funds. The distributor can register and login arn details. When we log into the distributor portal it shows the dashboard. 
The dashboard contains some icons available those are User profile, new Purchase, additional purchase, Systematic Investment Plan(SIP), and redemption.
In this project, I used to develop a user profile having a mobile number, email, joint holders, and nominees we can add up to 2 joint holders and 3 nominees  and also 
while entering PAN it auto-populated the name with KYC service through the rest API's. In this user profile module, I used HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax to perform
client-side validations.
