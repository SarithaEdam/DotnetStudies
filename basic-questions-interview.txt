I need to brush up my skills, I need little more time for preparation. 

Why do you left your previous company? 

I used work in kfintech company. I left the job because company made WFO mandatory from september month,but I couldn't make it.

Why you couldn't make WFO? 

I am going through some medical treatment. Doctor suggested me, not to travel for next one year.
