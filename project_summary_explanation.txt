I used to work on projects like mutual fund web applications, that have many modules. [User profile, new Purchase, additional purchase, SIP, STP, and their prepaid modules].
I developed some of the modules such as payment-process, user-profile, prepaid-STP, combo-SIP, and multi-goal-SIP.
I have used <MVC, rest API's, WCF services> tools to develop those modules.
I used to write validation checks using tool-stack <HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax>. [for user inputs] 
I used to deploy applications on UAT, pre-prod, and Prod environments.
I used to write documentation for the APIs that I have developed. 
Also used to support production issues 

Mutual funds such as Edelwise, Invesco, Nippon
